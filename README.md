A certificate of occupancy/use shall be required and obtained from the Code Enforcement
Officer prior to the occupancy or use of any BUILDING, STRUCTURE, or any portion
thereof which has been erected, structurally altered or changed in its use or
STRUCTURE, or with regard to the creation of a new use or change in use of any parcel
of land or portion thereof currently existing or hereinafter created. Before the issuance of
the certificate of occupancy/use, the Code Enforcement Officer shall determine that the
proposed use of the STRUCTURE or land conforms to the requirements of the Land Use
and Development Review Ordinances.
A change of occupancy that maintains the same land use classification shall not require
a certificate of occupancy unless site plan review is required. Where a BUILDING permit
or other land use permit is required, an application for a certificate of occupancy/use shall
be filed concurrently with that application and shall clearly state the intended use or uses
of the property. The certificate of occupancy/use may only be issued after a determination
that all work has been completed on the site and/or STRUCTURE in conformance with
Town Ordinances, any approved site plan or SUBDIVISION plan, any other applicable
town, state and federal requirements, and any conditions of approval imposed by the
PLANNING BOARD on the project. Occupancy without the required certificate shall be
deemed to be a violation of this Ordinance and subject to enforcement action as provided
in Article V, Enforcement and Penalties.
The Code Enforcement Officer may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy/use for a
period of time not to exceed six (6) months where it has been determined that adequate
safeguards are in place to assure the timely completion of the work. The Code
Enforcement Officer may require the posting of a bond or other financial security or
guarantee to assure completion of the project in accordance with its permitting.
### F. NON-CONFORMANCE
1. Any lawful use, BUILDING, STRUCTURES, premises, land, or parts thereof existing on
March 4, 1972, and not in conformance with the provisions of this Ordinance, shall be
considered to be non-conforming.
2. Non-conforming Uses:
Any non-conforming use in existence prior to March 4, 1972, may continue and may be
maintained, repaired, and improved. No such non-conforming use may be expanded,
changed to another non-conforming use, or renewed after it has been discontinued for a
period of twelve (12) calendar months or more. In the Shoreland Overlay Zone, this
provision shall not apply to the resumption of a use of a residential STRUCTURE provided
that the STRUCTURE has been used or maintained for residential purposes during the
preceding five (5) year period. Once a non-conforming use has been replaced by a
conforming use, it cannot subsequently be replaced by any non-conforming use.
9
3. NON-CONFORMING LOTS:
Any LOT one (1) acre or greater created between March 4, 1972, and April 1, 1993, and
any NON-CONFORMING LOTS in existence prior to March 4, 1972, shall be exempt from
the three (3) acre requirement in the Rural Residential District. Any LOT greater than
30,000 square feet or created between March 4, 1972, and June 5, 2001, and any NONCONFORMING LOTS in existence prior to March 4, 1972, shall be exempt from the two
(2) acre requirement in the Birch Point Sub-district. Any LOT one (1) acre or greater
created between March 4, 1972 and June 12, 2002, and any NON-CONFORMING LOTS
in existence prior to March 4, 1972, shall be exempt from the two (2) acre requirement in
the Residential District.
a. NON-CONFORMING LOTS: A NON-CONFORMING LOT of record as of the effective
date of this Ordinance or amendments thereto may be built upon, without the need for
a variance, provided that such LOT is in separate ownership and not contiguous with
any other LOT in the same ownership, and that all provisions of this Ordinance except
LOT size and frontage can be met. Variances relating to SETBACK or other
requirements not involving LOT size or frontage shall be obtained by action of the
Board of Appeals. No non-conforming lot of record shall be reduced in size to increase
the non-conformity of the lot.
b. Contiguous Built LOTS: If two (2) or more CONTIGUOUS LOTS or parcels are in a
single or joint ownership of record at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, if all or
part of the LOTS do not meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance, and if
a principal use or STRUCTURE exists on each LOT, the NON-CONFORMING LOTS
may be conveyed separately or together, provided that the State Minimum LOT Size
Law and Subsurface Wastewater Disposal Rules are complied with.
If two (2) or more principal uses or STRUCTURES existed on a single LOT of record
on the effective date of this Ordinance, each may be sold on a separate LOT provided
that the above referenced law and rules are complied with. When such LOTS are
divided each LOT thus created must be as conforming as possible to the dimensional
requirements of this Ordinance.
c. CONTIGUOUS LOTS – Vacant or Partially Built: If two (2) or more CONTIGUOUS
LOTS or parcels are in single or joint ownership of record at the time of or since
adoption or amendment of this Ordinance, if any of these LOTS do not individually
meet the dimensional requirements of this Ordinance or subsequent amendments,
and if a principle use or STRUCTURE exists on one (1) LOT and if one (1) or more of
the LOTS are vacant or contain no principal STRUCTURE the LOTS shall be
combined to the extent necessary to meet the dimensional requirement.
This paragraph is intended to apply to all LOTS, whether shown on an approved
recorded plan or not.
d. If a LOT is non-conforming by virtue of having more individual uses than would be
permitted in terms of having the required LOT area for the number of uses thereon,
the discontinuance of any use, conforming or non-conforming, for a period of twelve
(12) calendar months or more shall not allow said use to be resumed.
10
4. Non-conforming Structures:
A non-conforming STRUCTURE is a BUILDING or other STRUCTURE that fails to meet
one or more of the minimum SETBACK and LOT coverage standards of Article III of this
Ordinance.
Any non-conforming STRUCTURE which is removed, damaged or destroyed, regardless
of the cause, by more than 50% of the market value of the STRUCTURE before such
damage, destruction or removal may be reconstructed, replaced, or relocated provided
an approval from the Planning Board and a building permit from the Code Enforcement
Officer are obtained within one year of the date of said damage, destruction, or removal,
provided that such reconstruction, relocation or replacement is in compliance with all
SETBACK requirements to the greatest practical extent. Greatest practical extent will be
determined by the PLANNING BOARD in accordance with the purpose of this Ordinance,
the criteria specified below, and Article I, Section F(6). In no case shall a STRUCTURE
be reconstructed, relocated, or replaced so as to increase its non-conformity. If the
reconstructed, relocated, or replacement structure is less than the required SETBACKS
it shall not be any larger than the original structure, except as allowed pursuant to Article
I, Section F(5) below, as determined by the non-conforming floor area and volume of the
reconstructed, relocated, or replaced structure at its new location. If the total amount of
floor area and volume of the original structure can be relocated, reconstructed, or
replaced beyond the required SETBACK, no portion of the relocated, replaced, or
reconstructed structure shall be replaced, relocated or constructed at less than the
setback requirement for a new structure.
In determining whether the BUILDING reconstruction or replacement meets the water
SETBACK to the “greatest practical extent” the PLANNING BOARD shall consider in
addition to the criteria in paragraph two above and section F(6)(d) below, the type of
foundation present, if any. It is not the intent of this section to require the destruction of
functional concrete or block foundations in order to meet SETBACK requirements.

Any non-conforming STRUCTURE which is damaged or destroyed by 50% or less of the
market value of the STRUCTURE may be repaired or reconstructed in place provided an
approval from the Planning Board and a building permit from the Code Enforcement
Officer are obtained within one year of such damage or destruction, provided that the
FLOOR AREA or volume after the repair or reconstruction, is no greater than the FLOOR
AREA or volume before the damage or destruction.
A building permit for reconstruction, replacement, or relocation shall be renewable for a
total of only one year from its original date of issue if no substantial start of construction
has been made.
If a permit is not obtained within one year of said damage or destruction, repair or
reconstruction of any such STRUCTURE shall require an approval and/or permit from the
same authorities as that for a new such STRUCTURE.
Whenever a new, enlarged, or replacement foundation is constructed under a nonconforming structure in the shoreland zone, the structure and new foundation must be
placed such that the setback requirement is met to the greatest practical extent as
determined by the Planning Board or its designee, basing its decision on the criteria
specified in Article I, Section F(6)(d) below. If the completed foundation does not extend 
11
beyond the exterior dimensions of the structure, except for expansion in conformity with
Article I, Section F(5) below, and the foundation does not cause the structure to be
elevated by more than three (3) additional feet, as measured from the uphill side of the
structure (from original ground level to the bottom of the first floor sill), it shall not be
considered to be expansion of the structure.
5. Non-conforming BUILDINGS or other STRUCTURES may be altered or enlarged without
appeal providing that such extension, ALTERATION, or enlargement:
a. Will cause no additional or increased non-conformities with the minimum LOT
standards of Article III and will not cause the separately measured existing degree(s)
of inconsistency with ROAD, side, rear and shore SETBACK standards for the
negligible volume, open volume and enclosed volume portions of the STRUCTURE
to be increased so that any of the aforementioned portions of a STRUCTURE within
the SETBACK distance of a line shall expand no closer to said line; and
b. Shall not exceed 30% of the combined FLOOR AREA of the original non-conforming
portion of the STRUCTURE or 30% of the volume of the original non-conforming
portion of the STRUCTURE during the lifetime of the STRUCTURE. Any increases in
non-conforming FLOOR AREA and/or VOLUME approved by the Planning Board shall
be in writing, stating the approved percentage increases, and documented by the
applicant via an affidavit recorded in the Sagadahoc County Registry of Deeds prior
to the issuance of a Building Permit; and
c. Has received all applicable municipal, state, and federal approval(s) and permit(s)
from the Code Enforcement Officer.
6. Any non-conforming STRUCTURE may be changed to increase its conformity with the
standards of this Ordinance by:
a. Moving or changing all or part of the STRUCTURE in order to increase its compliance
with standards without adding or increasing other non-conformities except as varied
by the Appeals Board. Construction, enlargement or change of the foundation beneath
the STRUCTURE shall not be considered an expansion of the STRUCTURE provided
that it does not cause the STRUCTURE to be elevated by more than three additional
feet above grade and additionally in the Shoreland Overlay Zone the STRUCTURE
and its foundation shall be relocated so that the shore SETBACK is met to the greatest
practical extent as determined by the PLANNING BOARD whenever a new, enlarged
or replacement foundation is constructed. Any change in elevation is measured on
the water side of the STRUCTURE and the size of the foundation shall not exceed the
exterior dimensions of the existing STRUCTURE except as an allowed expansion.
b. Demolition and reconstruction of a STRUCTURE whose non-conforming area and
height, except as provided by in Art. I, F. 5, do not exceed that of the previous
STRUCTURE. Such STRUCTURES shall be inspected by the Code Enforcement
officer and certified as compliant with current Ordinances.
c. Both a. and b. shall be carried out to decrease the non-conformity to the maximum
extent.
12
d. In determining whether the building relocation meets the setback to the greatest
practical extent, the Planning Board or its designee shall consider the size of the lot,
the slope of the land, the potential for soil erosion, the location of other structures on
the property and on adjacent properties, the location of the septic system and other
on-site soils suitable for septic systems, and the type and amount of vegetation to be
removed to accomplish the relocation.
When it is necessary to remove vegetation within the water or WETLAND SETBACK
area in order to relocate a structure, the PLANNING BOARD shall require replanting
of native vegetation to compensate for the destroyed vegetation. In addition, the area
from which the relocated structure was removed must be replanted with vegetation.
Replanting shall be required as follows:
1) Trees removed in order to relocate a structure must be replanted with at least one
native tree, three (3) feet in height, for every tree removed. If more than five trees
are planted, no one species of tree shall make up more than 50% or the number
of trees planted. Replaced trees must be planted no further from the water or
wetland than the trees that were removed.
2) Other woody and herbaceous vegetation and ground cover that are removed or
destroyed in order to relocate a structure must be re-established. An area at least
the same size as the area where vegetation and/or ground cover was disturbed,
damaged, or removed must be re-established within the setback area. The
vegetation and/or ground cover must consist of similar native vegetation and/or
ground cover that was disturbed, destroyed, or removed.
3) Where feasible, when a structure is relocated on a parcel the non-impervious area
of the original location of the structure shall be replanted with vegetation which
may consist of grasses, shrubs, trees, or a combination thereof.
### G. VALIDITY AND SEVERABILITY
Should any section or provision of this Ordinance be declared by the courts to be invalid,
such decision shall not invalidate any other section or provision of this Ordinance.
### H. CONFLICTING ORDINANCES
Whenever a provision of this Ordinance is in conflict with another provision of this Ordinance,
or any other lawfully adopted rule, regulation, Ordinances, deed restrictions or covenants,
the most restrictive or that imposing the higher standards shall govern.
### I. AMENDMENTS

13
2. Special Town Meeting.
a. Purpose. While it is contemplated that the normal amendment process for this Land
Use Ordinance shall require presentation and adoption at the Town’s Annual Town
Budget Meeting, it is recognized that, from time to time, circumstances require that
changes be made to accommodate the needs of the community and its citizens and
to provide a process to deal with Ordinance change in a more timely fashion, where it
is deemed that such change is appropriate and a more timely consideration by the
Town Budget Meeting is deemed necessary.
1) Criteria. Land Use Ordinance changes proposed at a Special Town Meeting shall
meet the following criteria, which are mandatory and may not be waived:
a) The PLANNING BOARD and/or Code Enforcement Officer have reviewed the
proposed Ordinance changes and have made a recommendation regarding the

submitted its opinion that the objectives of the amendment(s) require changes
to the Land Use Ordinance and such objectives cannot be met under existing
Ordinance provisions.
c) The proposed Ordinance change(s) conform with the provisions of the Town of
West Bath COMPREHENSIVE PLAN.
2) The Town has had an opportunity to have Ordinance amendments reviewed by
the Town Attorney and such other organizations and municipal consultants as the
Selectmen may deem appropriate (such as Greater Portland COG).
3) The procedures set forth in Subsection 3 below have been followed.
3. Public Notification and Participation.
a. PLANNING BOARD Public Hearing. At the point in time where an amendment is
proposed under the expedited process provided in this Subsection, the PLANNING
BOARD shall schedule a Public Hearing. Notification of the Public Hearing shall be

shall be three (3) publications, the first no less than fourteen (14) days prior to the
scheduled Public Hearing, the second no less than seven (7) days prior to the
scheduled Public Hearing, and the last no less than two (2) days prior to the scheduled
Public Hearing. In addition, the PLANNING BOARD shall cause a Notice to be sent to
all parties-in-interest and to all abutters whose properties lie within five hundred feet
(500’) of property owned by the proponent of the Land Use Ordinance change,
including property located across TRAVELED WAYS. Said Notice to be by certified
mail with return receipt requested, and to be sent at least fourteen (14) days prior to
the scheduled Public Hearing.
b. Selectmen’s Public Hearing. At the point in time when the proposed Ordinance
amendments are in draft form, the Selectmen shall schedule a Public Hearing to allow
public comment and receive input regarding the proposed amendments. Notification 
14
of the Public Hearing shall be in the same manner as the PLANNING BOARD Public
Hearing in Section a. above.
c. Additional Public Hearing. If the Selectmen’s Public Hearing provided for in Section b.
above results in significant changes to the original draft of the amendments, a
subsequent public hearing shall be held to receive public comment and input on the
amended draft. The procedure for calling such a public hearing shall be the same as
the PLANNING BOARD’S hearing except that notice to parties-in-interest and abutters
shall not be required.
d. Rejection by Voters. If proposed amendments to the Land Use Ordinance are rejected
by the voters at a Special Town Meeting, those same amendments may not be
presented at another Special Town Meeting; but may only be considered at the Town’s
Annual Town Budget Meeting.

FOOTNOTES:
1 – All SETBACKS are measured as the minimum horizontal distance irrespective of the slope of the land, to the
footprint of a STRUCTURE or the vertical projection to ground level of portions of the STRUCTURE having usable
volume or FLOOR AREA whichever distance is smaller. Usable portions do not include eaves, decorative trim,
flower boxes and trellises. STRUCTURES which are only or principally roofs such as car ports or gas station pump
shelters shall have their SETBACKS measured from the vertical projection to ground of the outermost portions of
the STRUCTURE. ROAD SETBACKS shall be measured from the center of the TRAVELED WAY. SETBACKS
apply to any STRUCTURE with the exception of the following:
- Boundary fences and walls, SHARED DRIVEWAYS and rights of way on boundary lines,
- Small entities such as birdbaths, birdhouses and lampposts
SETBACKS apply not only to paved but also natural dirt, gravel or ledge parking LOTS. SETBACKS apply to large
movable entities including stored vehicles (cars, trucks, RVs, trailers and boats), containers and dumpsters. ROAD
SETBACKS do not apply to DRIVEWAYS.
2 – The Minimum ROAD Frontage shall be an uninterrupted distance measured along the property line adjacent to
a single TRAVELED WAY. For corner LOTS it shall be measured along the most heavily TRAVELED WAY.
3 – Special standards allow CLUSTER SUBDIVISIONS in these districts. The number of LOTS allowed in any
residential SUBDIVISION, in any district, whether it is a CLUSTER SUBDIVISION or standard SUBDIVISION, shall
be calculated by dividing the NET RESIDENTIAL ACREAGE by the minimum LOT size standard for the district in
which the SUBDIVISION is proposed. Any fractional portion of the result of this calculation shall not count for an
additional LOT. NET RESIDENTIAL ACREAGE shall be calculated as provided for in Section 9.3 of the
Development Review Ordinance, which is entitled “Land Not Suitable for Development”. CLUSTER SUBDIVISION
proposals on properties partially or wholly located in the Shoreland Overlay Zone shall not be permitted to reduce
minimum LOT standards applicable in the underlying district under this Ordinance.
4 – A LOT size of one (1) acre is allowed when municipal sewerage is used.

twenty-four (24) feet from the surveyed edge of the right-of-way, except that this provision shall not apply to
SUBDIVISIONS of four (4) lots or more.
[Note: This is to limit the SETBACK change to minimum ROAD SETBACK and redefining the measurement of said
SETBACK to avoid problems when a ROAD is not centered in the surveyed right-of-way. The sixteen (16) foot
change in measurement assumes a two (2) rod wide right-of-way.]
7 – Public water and sewerage required in this district.
8 – In the Business and Commercial District the ROAD SETBACK for parking LOTS and side SETBACKS may be
reduced by the PLANNING BOARD when necessary for functional or topographic reasons however the vegetative
boundary strip requirement cannot be waived. When side SETBACKS are reduced special screening requirements
may be imposed.
9 – For single LOTS with multiple detached DWELLING UNITS special standards for DWELLING UNIT separation
are imposed to create the equivalent of side SETBACKS.
10 – High occupancy uses in Residential District 2 and Rural Residential District 3 intended to serve more than
twelve (12) PERSONS at one time shall have LOT Size, ROAD, Side and Rear SETBACK Standards increased by
their nominal value for every tripling of the number of PERSONS beyond twelve (12), thereby applying multipliers
of two (2) for twelve (12) to thirty-six (36) PERSONS, three (3) for thirty-six (36) to one hundred and eight (108)
PERSONS, four (4) for one hundred and eight PERSONS to three hundred and twenty-four (324) PERSONS and

Depending on the nature of the use the PLANNING BOARD may require special screening of the use from abutting
residential properties.
11 – Back LOTS not having frontage on a ROAD other than that of an access corridor or having access via an
EASEMENT must have in lieu of frontage a configuration such that a square having sides equal in length to the
ROAD frontage requirement for the district in which the LOT is located can be laid out on land suitable for
development within the boundaries of the LOT.
12 – Construction of sidewalks required as part of infrastructure development.
13 – SETBACK is measured from the edge of the surveyed right of way. SETBACK may be reduced up to thirty
(30) feet (leaving a minimum SETBACK of twenty (20) feet) with a SETBACK reduction plan approved by the
PLANNING BOARD.

of coastal bluff that has been identified on Coastal Bluff maps as being “highly unstable” or “unstable” by the Maine
Geological Survey pursuant to its “Classification of Coastal Bluffs” and published on the most recent Coastal Bluff
map. If the applicant and the permitting official(s) are in disagreement as to the specific location of a “highly unstable”
or “unstable” bluff, or where the top of the bluff is located, the applicant may at his or her expense, employ a Maine
Registered Professional Engineer, a Maine Certified Soil Scientist or a Maine State Geologist to make a
determination. If agreement is still not reached, the applicant may appeal the matter to the Board of Appeals.
17. – Clearing of vegetation in excess of that required for LOT access or development shall not be conducted any
closer to property lines than twice the applicable SETBACK for the land use district in which the LOT is located.

height of a BUILDING or other STRUCTURES shall not exceed 35 feet where the height
is measured from the average finished grade level at the foundation of the side visible
from the water (where the average grade measurement points can be no higher than 3
feet above original average grade level prior to construction) to the highest point of the
STRUCTURE, excluding chimneys, copulas, antennas and other appurtenances that
have no FLOOR AREA.
Explanatory Note: Posts having minimal visual impact which are supplemental to a
STRUCTURE’S foundation, such as those for a BUILDING’S deck, are not considered
when determining a BUILDING’S height. The non-shoreland median height restriction
would be applicable to the inland, not visible from the water side(s) of the BUILDING.
Diagrams illustrating how average grade levels are calculated are included as an
Appendix to this Ordinance.

longer physically present at the location. All business signage installed after April 1, 2022,
shall conform to the requirements of this subsection (6).
Note: All commercial signs must meet the additional sign requirements in the
Development Review Ordinance.
7. Minimum LOT size shall be one acre. If more than one principal STRUCTURE is
constructed on a single parcel, the applicable minimum frontage and minimum LOT size
from the Minimum LOT Standards Table in Article III. Section A. shall be multiplied by the
number of principal STRUCTURES, excepting, if applicable, one business owner
occupied DWELLING UNIT, to obtain the minimum frontages and minimum LOT size
requirements for the parcel.
8. Every STRUCTURE shall have a minimum SETBACK of 75 feet from the normal high
water mark, or, in the case of a coastal or INLAND WETLAND, 75’ from the UPLAND
EDGE of said WETLAND. In the case of a GREAT POND the minimum SETBACK for
STRUCTURES shall be 100 feet from the normal high water line.
9. The median height of BUILDINGS or other STRUCTURES with the exception of
telecommunication, utility and water towers and poles shall not exceed 35 feet except in

WETLAND 10 or more acres in size, STRUCTURES and man-made non-vegetated area
combined shall not cover more than 20% of any LOT.
11. In the Business and Commercial District, in order to help preserve existing vegetation for
meeting the buffer requirements associated with future development, PLANNING
BOARD approval is required prior to the clearing of any more vegetation beyond that
which is necessary to provide one vehicular access to the front of the property, even if
no development is proposed at the time of the proposed clearing. Clearing for the one
vehicular access shall not exceed 40 feet in width.
a. Prior to clearing of more vegetation than is needed for a vehicular access, the owner
of the property shall prepare and submit to the PLANNING BOARD a clearing plan
that demonstrates on a plan of the property:
37
i. How the owner plans to comply with the DRIVEWAY maximum width requirement

ii. How the owner plans to comply with the vegetative buffer requirements applicable
to properties in the Business and Commercial District that are contained in Article
XIII, Section 13.10 of the Development Review Ordinance.
b. The clearing plan shall indicate that cleared vegetation in excess of that needed to
provide one access to the property shall be replanted within the buffer-strip areas
required if and when the LOT is developed or redeveloped, and show the location of
these buffer strip areas. The clearing plan shall also state that any areas planned for
clearing, whether or not they are now part of a required buffer area shall be replanted
if they fall within the buffer strip area on a LOT that is part of a future SUBDIVISION
of the property.
c. The owner of the property shall obtain PLANNING BOARD approval of the Clearing
Plan before clearing more vegetation than is necessary to create a single 40-foot wide
access to the property.

constructed or modified such that the facility produces no discharge of effluent or
contaminated storm water. Spreading, disposal or storage of manure within the
Shoreland Overlay Zone shall require a Soil and Water Conservation Plan to be filed
with the PLANNING BOARD.
d. Non-conformance with the provisions of a Soil and Water Conservation Plan shall be
considered to be a violation of this Ordinance.
NOTE: Assistance in preparing a soil and water conservation plan may be available through
the Androscoggin Valley Soil and Water Conservation District Office.
### E. BEACHES
1. Construction of a beach on any GREAT POND or COASTAL WETLAND shall require a
permit from the Department of Environmental Protection. Beach construction on any
river, STREAM, or brook capable of floating watercraft shall also require approval by the
Department of Environmental Protection, as required by State Law.
### F. EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL
Development subject to site plan review and/or SUBDIVISION review under the
Development Review Ordinance shall be subject to erosion and sedimentation control
standards contained in Article XIII, Section 13.12. Irrespective of whether site plan or
SUBDIVISION review is required, all soil disturbing activities that require a permit shall also
be subject to the following standards:
1. Town wide Standards: Filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, earth-moving activities, and
other land use activities shall be conducted in such a manner as to prevent to the
maximum extent possible erosion and sedimentation of surface waters.
2. In the Shoreland Overlay Zone: All filling, grading, lagooning, dredging, earth-moving
activities, and other land use activities which result in unstabilized soil conditions, and
which require a permit shall require a written soil erosion and sedimentation control plan.
a. The plan shall be submitted to the permitting authority for approval and shall include,
where applicable, provisions for:
i. Mulching and re-vegetation of disturbed soil.
ii. Temporary runoff control features such as hay bales, sit fencing or diversion
ditches.
39
iii. Permanent stabilization STRUCTURES such as retaining walls or riprap.
b. In order to create the least potential for erosion, development shall be designed to fit
with the topography and soils of the site. Areas of steep slopes where high cuts and
fills may be required shall be avoided wherever possible, and natural contours shall
be followed as closely as possible.
c. Erosion and sedimentation control measures shall apply to all aspects of the proposed
project involving land disturbance and shall be in operation during all stages of the
activity. The amount of exposed soil at every phase of construction shall be minimized
to reduce the potential for erosion.
d. Any exposed ground area shall be temporarily or permanently stabilized within one
(1) week from the time it was last actively worked, by use of riprap, sod, seed, and
mulch, or other effective measures. In all cases permanent stabilization shall occur
within nine (9) months of the initial date of exposure. In addition:
i. Where mulch is used, it shall be applied at a rate of at least one (1) bale per five
hundred (500) square feet and shall be maintained until a catch of vegetation is
established.
ii. Anchoring the mulch with netting, peg and twin or other suitable method may be
required to maintain the mulch cover.
iii. Additional measures shall be taken where necessary in order to avoid siltation into
the water. Such measures may include the use of staked hay bales and/or silt
fences.
e. Natural and man-made drainage ways and drainage outlets shall be protected from
erosion from water flowing through them. Drainage ways shall be designed and
constructed to be able to carry water from at least a twenty-five (25) year storm, and
shall be stabilized with vegetation or lined with rip-rap.
NOTE: Technical specifications for erosion and sedimentation control measures that can be used to meet
the standards of Article III, Section F., above, can be found in the “Maine Erosion and Sediment Control
Handbook for Construction: Best Management Practices” by the Cumberland County Soil and Water
Conservation District, published by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection in March 1991, a
copy of which shall remain on file with the Code Enforcement Officer in the Town Office.
### G. MINERAL EXPLORATION AND EXTRACTION

permits which may be required for such STRUCTURES and uses, they shall conform to the
following:
1. Access from shore shall be developed on soils appropriate for such use and constructed
so as to control erosion.
2. The location shall not interfere with developed beach areas.
3. The facility shall be located so as to minimize effects on fisheries.
4. The facility shall be no larger than is necessary to carry on the activity and be consistent
with existing conditions, uses, and character of the area.
5. No new enclosed SECONDARY STRUCTURE shall be built on, over or abutting a pier,
wharf, dock or other PRIMARY STRUCTURE extending beyond the high-water line of a
WATER BODY or within a WETLAND unless the SECONDARY STRUCTURE requires
direct access to the water as an operational necessity.
6. No existing SECONDARY STRUCTURES built on, over or abutting a pier, dock, wharf or
other PRIMARY STRUCTURE extending beyond the normal high-water line of a WATER
BODY or within a WETLAND shall be converted to residential DWELLING UNITS in any
district.
7. SECONDARY STRUCTURES built on, over or abutting a pier, wharf, dock or other
PRIMARY STRUCTURE extending beyond the normal high-water line of a WATER
BODY or within a WETLAND shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height above the working
surface of the PRIMARY STRUCTURE. Ramp-handling gantry frames and flagpoles shall
be exempt from this height limitation.
NOTE: Permanent STRUCTURES projecting into or over water bodies shall require a permit from the
Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) pursuant to the Natural Resources Protection Act, Title
38 M.R.S.A., Sect. 480-C. Permanent STRUCTURES (see above) and STRUCTURES projecting below
the high-water mark, but above the low water mark, may also require a permit from the United States
Army Corps of Engineers. Please refer to the Code Enforcement Officer for information on proper
permitting. If the subject of application is a seasonal dock which is not a permanent STRUCTURE
extending below the high-water line, and subject only to DEP Permit-by Rule requirements, DEP may not
notify the applicant of their approval, as approval is automatic unless subject to a rejection. Please check
with the Code Enforcement Officer.
8. SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS: Application for piers, docks, wharves, and other
structures extending into or over water bodies:
a. Completed application.
b. Approval or Permit from DEP or Army Corps of Engineers, or other such
regulating entity as applicable.

when completed.
9. SETBACK: The fixed portion of a pier, dock, wharf, or other STRUCTURE shall be
constructed no closer than 25 feet, from any boundary line of an abutting property, or the
adjusted projection of any boundary, by the Colonial Method or such other method as
approved by the Planning Board, of the boundary line thereof or not closer than the
minimum SETBACK for the district in which the LOT is located, whichever is greater
10. DOCK AND FLOAT SEPARATION: The minimum distance from any portion of a dock,
including its float, shall not be less than twenty-five (25) feet or the minimum side
SETBACK requirement for the district in which it is located, whichever is greater, to any
portion of another float or dock. Reduction of the requirement for minimum distance
between docks, is available to the applicant through variance, provided that the applicant
can demonstrate that no alternative design is practical, the inability to meet the
requirement is due to the location characteristics, and/or design of the abutter’s existing
dock.
11. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES: Low level enclosed storage units for marine equipment
no higher than 3 feet and no greater in volume than 75 cubic feet may be allowed within
75 feet of the high water mark provided that they are screened from water view by

applicant demonstrates that no reasonable alternative access exists on the property.
Connection of said stairway or STRUCTURE to an approved dock is allowed.
### I. CUTTING OF TREES FOR DEVELOPMENT AND SAFETY
1. Relationship to Buffer Requirements. Developments subject to site plan or
SUBDIVISION review are subject to the standards of this subsection and additional
restrictions on clearing and buffer requirements contained in Art. XIII, 13.10 of the
Development Review Ordinance.
2. Clearing or Removal of Vegetation in the Shoreland Overlay Zone for Activities Other
Than Timber Harvesting.
a. In a Resource Protection District abutting a great pond, there shall be no cutting of
vegetation within the strip of land extending 75 feet, horizontal distance, inland from
the normal high-water line, except to remove safety hazards.
42
Elsewhere, in any Resource Protection District the cutting or removal of vegetation
shall be limited to that which is necessary for uses expressly authorized in that district.
b. Except in areas described in Section I(2)(a) above, except to allow for the
development of permitted uses, within a strip of land extending one hundred (100)
feet, horizontal distance, inland from the normal high-water line of a GREAT POND
classified GPA or a river flowing to a great pond classified GPA extending seventyfive (75) feet, horizontal distance inland from the normal high-water line of any other
WATER BODY, TRIBUTARY STREAM, or the UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND, a
buffer strip of vegetation shall be preserved as follows:
(i) There shall be no cleared opening greater than 250 square feet in the forest
canopy (or other existing woody vegetation if a forested canopy is not present)
as measured from the outer limits of the tree or shrub crown. However, a
footpath not to exceed six (6) feet in width as measured between tree trunks
and/or shrub stems is allowed provided that a cleared line of sight to the water
through the buffer strip is not created.
(ii) Selective cutting of trees within the buffer strip is allowed, provided that a welldistributed stand of trees and other vegetation is maintained. For the purposes
Section I, a "well distributed stand of trees” adjacent to a great pond classified
GPA or a river or stream flowing to a great pond classified GPA shall be
defined as maintaining a rating score of 24 or more in each 25-foot by 50-foot
rectangular (1250 square feet) area as determined by the following rating
system:
Diameter of Tree at 4 and ½ feet
Above Ground Level (inches) Points
- 2 to 4 inches 1
- Greater than 4 to 12 inches 2
- Greater than 12 inches 4
- 12 inches or greater 8
Adjacent to other water bodies, tributary streams, and wetlands, a “well-distributed
stand of trees” is defined as maintaining a minimum rating score of 16 per 25 foot by
50 foot rectangular area.
Note: As an example, adjacent to a great pond, if a 25-foot by 50-foot plot
contains four (4) trees between 2 and 4 inches in a diameter, two (2) trees
between 4 and 8 inches in diameter, and three trees between 8 and 12 inches
in diameter, and two trees over 12 inches in diameter, the rating score is:
(4x1) + (2x2) + (3x4) = 36 points
Thus, the 25-foot plot by 50-foot plot contains trees worth 36 points. Trees
totaling 12 points (36 – 24 = 12) may be removed from the plot provided that
no cleared openings are created.
43
The following shall govern in applying this point system:
(a) The 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular plots must be established where the
landowner or lessee proposes clearing within the required buffer;
(b) Each successive plot must be adjacent to, but not overlap a previous plot;
(c) Any plot not containing the required points must have no vegetation removed
except as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance;
(d) Any plot containing the required points may have vegetation removed down
to the minimum points required or as otherwise allowed by this Ordinance.
(e) Where conditions permit, no more than fifty (50) percent of the point on any
25-foot by 50-foot rectangular area may consist of trees greater than 12
inches in diameter.
For the purposes of this Section 1.2(b)(ii), “other natural vegetation” is defined as
retaining existing vegetation under three (3) feet in height and other ground cover
and retaining at least five (5) saplings less than two (2) inches in diameter at four
and one half (4 ½) feet above ground level for each 25-foot by 50-foot rectangular
area. If five saplings do not exist, no woody stems less than two (2) inches in
diameter can be removed until 5 saplings have been recruited into the plot.
Notwithstanding the above provisions, no more than 40% of the total volume of trees
four (4) inches or more in diameter, measured at 4 and 1/2 feet above ground level
may be removed in any ten (10) year period.
(iii) In order to protect water quality and wildlife habitat, existing vegetation under
three (3) feet in height and other ground cover, including leaf litter and the
forest duff layer, shall not be cut, covered, or removed, except to provide for a
footpath or other permitted uses as described in Section I paragraphs (2)(b)
and (2)(b)(i) above.
(iv) Pruning of tree branches, on the bottom 1/3 of the tree is permitted.
(v) Storm-damaged, diseased, dead or unsafe trees may be removed with the
approval of the Code Enforcement Officer. In order to maintain a buffer strip
of vegetation, when such removal results in the creation of cleared openings,
these openings shall be replanted with native tree species unless existing new
tree growth is present.
Section 1(2)(b) does not apply to those portions of public recreation facilities
adjacent to public swimming areas as long as cleared areas are limited to the
minimum area necessary.
(vi) At distances greater than one hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance from the
normal high-water line of a GREAT POND classified GPA or a river flowing to
a great pond classified GPA, or seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance,
from the normal high-water line of any WATER BODY, TRIBUTARY STREAM,
or the UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND, except to allow for the development of
permitted uses, there shall be allowed on any LOT, in any ten (10) year period,
selective cutting of not more than forty (40) percent of the volume of trees four
(4) inches or more in diameter, measured 4 and 1/2 feet above ground level. 
44
Tree removal in conjunction with the development of permitted uses shall be
included in the forty (40) percent calculation. For the purposes of these
standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
In no event shall cleared openings for any purpose, including but not limited
to, principal and accessory STRUCTURES, DRIVEWAYS, lawns, and sewage
disposal areas, exceed in the aggregate, 25% of the LOT area within the
Shoreland Overlay Zone or ten thousand (10,000) square feet, whichever is
greater, including land previously cleared. This provision shall not apply to the
General Development or Commercial Fisheries/Maritime Activities Districts.
(vii) Cleared openings legally in existence on the effective date of this Ordinance
may be maintained, but shall not be enlarged, except as permitted in this
Ordinance.
(viii) Fields and other cleared openings which have reverted to primary shrubs,
trees, or other woody vegetation shall be regulated under the provisions of this
Section I.
### J. TIMBER HARVESTING
1. In the Shoreland Overlay Zone
a. In the Resource Protection Overlay Zone abutting a GREAT POND, TIMBER
HARVESTING shall be limited to the following:
i. Within the strip of land extending 75 feet inland from the normal high-water line
there shall be no TIMBER HARVESTING except to remove safety hazards.
ii. Beyond the 75 foot “no-harvest” strip referred to in paragraph i. above, TIMBER
HARVESTING is permitted in accordance with paragraph (ii) below except that in
no case shall the average residual basal area of trees over 1 inch in diameter at
4 1/2 feet above ground level be reduced to less than 30 square feet per acre.
b. Except in areas as described in paragraph a., above, TIMBER HARVESTING shall
conform with the following provisions:
i. Selective cutting of no more than forty (40) percent of the total volume of trees four
(4) inches or more in diameter measured at 4 1/2 feet above ground level on any
LOT in any ten (10) year period is permitted. In addition:
a) Within one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance of the normal high-water line
of a GREAT POND classified GPA, and within seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal
distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies, TRIBUTARY
STREAMS, or the UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND, there shall be no clear-cut
openings and a well-distributed stand of trees and other vegetation including
existing ground cover shall be maintained.
b) At distances greater than one-hundred (100) feet, horizontal distance of a
GREAT POND classified GPA and greater than seventy-five (75) feet, 
45
horizontal distance, of the normal high-water line of other water bodies or the
UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND, harvesting operations shall not create single
clear-cut openings greater than ten-thousand (10,000) square feet in the forest
canopy. Where such openings exceed five-thousand (5,000) square feet they
shall be at least one-hundred (100) feet apart. Such clear-cut openings shall
be included in the calculation of the total volume removal. For the purposes of
these standards volume may be considered to be equivalent to basal area.
ii. TIMBER HARVESTING operations exceeding the 40% limitation in paragraph a.
above, may be allowed by the PLANNING BOARD upon a clear showing, including
a forest management plan signed by a Maine licensed professional forester, that
such an exception is necessary for good forest management and will be carried
out in accordance with the purposes of this Ordinance. The PLANNING BOARD
shall notify the Commissioner of the Department of Environmental Protection of
each exception allowed, within fourteen (14) days of the PLANNING BOARD’S
decision.
iii. No accumulation of slash shall be left within fifty (50) feet of the normal high-water
line of a WATER BODY. In all other areas slash shall either be removed or
disposed of in such a manner that it lies on the ground and no part thereof extends
more than four (4) feet above the ground. Any debris that falls below the normal
high-water line of a WATER BODY shall be removed.
iv. TIMBER HARVESTING equipment shall not use STREAM channels as travel
routes except when:
a) Surface waters are frozen; and
b) The activity will not result in any ground disturbance.
v. All Crossings of flowing water shall require a bridge or culvert, except in areas with
low banks and channel beds which are composed of gravel, rock or similar hard
surface which would not be eroded or otherwise damaged.
a) Skid trail approaches to WATER CROSSINGS shall be located and designed
so as to prevent water runoff from directly entering the WATER BODY or
TRIBUTARY STREAM. Upon completion of TIMBER HARVESTING, temporary
bridges and culverts shall be removed and areas of exposed soil revegetated.
b) Except for WATER CROSSINGS, skid trails and other sites where the operation
of machinery used in TIMBER HARVESTING results in the exposure of mineral
soil shall be located such that an unscarified strip of vegetation of at least
seventy-five (75) feet in width for slopes up to ten (10) percent shall be retained
between the exposed mineral soil and the normal high-water line of a WATER
BODY or UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND. For each ten (10) percent increase
in slope, the unscarified strip shall be increased by twenty (20) feet. The
provisions of this paragraph apply only to a face sloping toward the WATER
BODY or WETLAND, provided, however, that no portion of such exposed
mineral soil on a back face shall be closer than twenty five (25) feet from the
normal high-water line of a WATER BODY or UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND.
46
### K. DRIVEWAY AND ROAD CONSTRUCTION
Approval from the Town ROAD Commissioner is required for all DRIVEWAYS or ROADS
when they intersect a public ROAD. Additional standards that apply to ARTERIAL, ROAD,
and DRIVEWAY construction subject to the SUBDIVISION or site plan review are contained
in Article X, Section 10.2, sub-section L. 1-6.
1. ROADS and DRIVEWAYS shall be located, constructed, and maintained in such a
manner that minimal erosion hazard results. Adequate provision shall be made to prevent
soil erosion and sedimentation of surface waters, but in no case shall a DRIVEWAY or
ROAD have more than a five percent grade within fifty (50) feet of an intersection of a
Town Road, State Road, or State Aid Road.
2. Additionally, all ROADS constructed shall conform with the following standards:
a. ROAD crossings of watercourses shall be kept to the minimum number necessary.
b. The bottom of culverts shall be installed at streambed level.
c. All areas of exposed mineral soil shall be re-vegetated or otherwise stabilized as soon
as possible.
d. Bridges and culverts of adequate size and design shall be provided for all ROAD
crossings of water courses which are to be used when surface waters are unfrozen.
The requirement for a bridge or culvert will be left to the approval of the ROAD
Commissioner and the PLANNING BOARD.
### L. ROADS AND DRIVEWAYS IN THE SHORELAND OVERLAY ZONE
The following standards shall apply to the construction of ROADS and/or DRIVEWAYS and
drainage systems, culverts and other related features.
1. ROADS and DRIVEWAYS shall be set back at least 100 feet, horizontal distance, from
the normal high-water line of a GREAT POND classified GPA or a river that flows to a
great pond classified GPA, and seventy-five (75) feet, horizontal distance from the normal
high-water line of other water bodies, TRIBUTARY STREAMS, or the UPLAND EDGE of
a WETLAND unless no reasonable alternatives exist as determined by the PLANNING
BOARD. If no other reasonable alternative exists, the PLANNING BOARD may reduce
the ROAD and/or DRIVEWAY SETBACK requirement to no less than fifty (50) feet,
horizontal distance, upon clear showing by the applicant that appropriate techniques will
be used to prevent sedimentation of the WATER BODY, TRIBUTARY STREAM OR
WETLAND. Such techniques may include but are not limited to, the installation of settling
basins, and/or the effective use of additional ditch relief culverts and turnouts placed so
as to avoid sedimentation of the WATER BODY, TRIBUTARY STREAM, or WETLAND.
On slopes of greater than twenty (20) percent of the ROAD and/or DRIVEWAY SETBACK
shall be increased by ten (10) feet for each five (5) percent increase in slope above twenty
(20) percent.
47
This Section L.(1) does not apply to approaches to WATER CROSSINGS nor to ROADS
or DRIVEWAYS that provide access to permitted STRUCTURES, and facilities located
nearer to the shoreline or tributary STREAM due to an operational necessity, such as a
boat launching ramp, excluding temporary docket for recreational uses. Roads and
driveways providing access to permitted structures within the SETBACK area shall
comply fully with the requirements of Article III, Section L except for that portion of the
road or driveway necessary for direct access to the structure.
2. Existing public ROADS may be expanded within the legal right-of-way regardless of its
SETBACK from a WATER BODY, TRIBUTARY STREAM or WETLAND.
3. New ROADS and DRIVEWAYS are prohibited in a Resource Protection Overlay Zone
except that the PLANNING BOARD may grant a permit to construct a road or driveway
to provide access to permitted uses within the district. A road or driveway may also be
approved by the PLANNING BOARD in a Resource Protected District, upon a finding that
no reasonable alternative route or location is available outside district. When a ROAD or
DRIVEWAY is permitted in a Resource Protection District, the ROAD and/or DRIVEWAY
shall be set back as far as practicable from the normal high-water line of a WATER BODY,
TRIBUTARY STREAM, or UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND.
4. ROAD and DRIVEWAY banks shall be no steeper than a slop of two (2) horizontal to one
(1) vertical and shall be graded and stabilized in accordance with the provisions for
erosion and sedimentation control contained in subsection F of this Article.
5. ROAD and DRIVEWAY grades shall be no greater than ten (10) percent except for short
segments of less than two hundred (200) feet.
6. In order to prevent ROAD and DRIVEWAY surface drainage from directly entering
WATER BODIES, TRIBUTARY STREAMS or WETLANDS, ROADS AND DRIVEWAYS
shall be designed, constructed, and maintained to empty onto an unscarified buffer strip
at least fifty (50) feet plus two times the average slope, in width between the outflow point
of the ditch or culvert and the normal high-water line of a WATER BODY, TRIBUTARY
STREAM or UPLAND EDGE of a WQETLAND. Surface drainage which is directed to an
unscarified buffer strip shall be diffused or spread out to promote infiltration of the runoff
and to minimize channelized flow of the drainage through the buffer strip.
7. Ditch relief (cross drainage) culverts, drainage dips and water turnouts shall be installed
in a manner effective in directing drainage onto unscarified buffer strips before the flow
gains sufficient volume or head to erode the ROAD, DRIVEWAY or ditch. To accomplish
this, the following shall apply:
48
a. Ditch relief culverts, drainage dips and associated water turnouts shall be spaced
along the ROAD or DRIVEWAY at intervals no greater than indicated in the following
table:
Grade Spacing
(Percent) (Feet)
0-2 250
3-5 200-135
6-10 100-80
11-15 80-60
16-20 60-45
21+ 40
b. Drainage dips may be used in place of ditch relief culverts only where the ROAD grade
is ten (10) percent or less.
c. On sections having slopes greater than ten (10) percent, ditch relief culverts shall be
placed at approximately a thirty (30) degree angle down-slope from a line
perpendicular to the centerline of the ROAD or DRIVEWAY.
d. Ditch relief culverts shall be sufficiently sized and properly installed in order to allow
for effective functioning, and their inlet and outlet ends shall be stabilized with
appropriate materials.
8. Ditches, culverts, bridges, dips, water turnouts and other storm water runoff control
installations associated with ROADS and DRIVEWAYS shall be maintained on a regular
basis to assure effective functioning.
### M. PARKING AREAS IN THE SHORELAND OVERLAY ZONE
1. Parking areas shall meet the shoreline SETBACK requirements for STRUCTURES for
the district in which such areas are located and minimum setback requirements from
TRIBUTARY STREAMS within the Shoreland Zone. The SETBACK requirement for
parking areas serving public boat launching facilities may be reduced to no less than fifty
(50) feet from the normal high-water line or UPLAND EDGE of a WETLAND if the
PLANNING BOARD finds that no other reasonable alternative exists.
2. Parking areas shall be adequately sized for the proposed use and shall be designed to
prevent storm-water runoff from flowing directly into a WATER BODY, and where feasible,
to retain all runoff on-site.
3. In determining the appropriate size of proposed parking facilities, the following should
apply:
a. Typical parking space: Approximately ten (10) feet wide and twenty (20) feet long,
except that parking spaces for a vehicle and boat trailer shall be forty (40) feet long.
b. Internal travel aisles: Approximately twenty (20) feet wide.
49
### N. ESSENTIAL SERVICES IN THE SHORELAND OVERLAY ZONE
1. Where feasible, the installation of essential services shall be limited to existing public
ways and existing service corridors.
2. The installation of essential services is not permitted in a Resource Protection Overlay
Zone or within 75 feet, horizontal distance, of a STREAM, except to provide services to a
permitted use within said overlay zone, or except where the applicant demonstrates that
no reasonable alternative exists. Where permitted, such STRUCTURES and facilities
shall be located so as to minimize any adverse impacts on surrounding uses and
resources, including visual impacts.
3. Essential services shall be defined to include the following: gas, electrical or
communications facilities; steam, fuel, electric power or water transmission of distribution

67
that imposes specific time periods for completion of review of completed Board of Appeals
application/appeals.
### E. VARIANCES
1. Variance Defined – Variance is the relaxation of the terms of this Ordinance where such
a variance would not be contrary to the public interest, and where, owing to conditions
peculiar to the property and not the result of actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement
of this Ordinance would result in unnecessary or undue hardship.
a. Undue hardship relates to a problem created by some feature of the land, not a
personal problem of the applicant.
b. Practical difficulty means that the strict application of the Ordinance to the property
precludes the ability of the petitioner to pursue a use permitted in the zoning district in
which the property is located and results in significant economic injury to the petitioner.
c. Dimensional Standards means and is limited to Ordinance provisions relating to LOT
area, LOT coverage, frontage, and SETBACK requirements.
d. An undesirable change in the neighborhood as it relates to the “practical difficult”
variance is defined so that the STRUCTURE can be no larger or closer to the ROAD
or property lines than the majority of STRUCTURES within that neighborhood or would
not result in a percentage of LOT coverage which was greater than the majority of
LOTS in that neighborhood.
e. Unreasonable detrimental effect is defined so that a variance for the subject property
will not block an established view, pose a fire safety hazard, or reduce the appraised
value of the adjoining LOT.
2. Items for which a variance may be granted – As used in this Code, a variance may be
authorized for only the following items:
a. Minimum LOT area except for Bulk Hazardous Substance Uses
b. SETBACKS except for distance from normal high water mark or UPLAND EDGE of a
WETLAND.
c. LOT frontage, ROAD frontage, shore frontage
d. Percentage of a LOT coverage
e. Temporary disability access
f. DRIVEWAY or ROAD grade within fifty (50) feet of an intersection with a Town Road,
State Aid Road, or State Road.
Establishment of a use otherwise prohibited shall not be allowed by variance.
68
3. Application – Application for a variance shall be made to the Code Enforcement Officer
on forms provided for that purpose. The application shall be accompanied by the filing
fee, which will be determined by the Selectmen on an annual basis. The applicant shall
also pay all advertising fees required by state or local Ordinances to meet legal notice
requirements.
4. Procedure – The Code Enforcement Officer shall forward the application for variance to
the Board of Appeals. Upon receipt of the application, the Board shall set the matter for
hearing at its next scheduled meeting. The time, date, and place of the public hearing on
the application shall be advertised in a newspaper having general circulation in the Town
of West Bath at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing. The Board shall notify
all abutters in writing of the pendency of the application in accordance with LAND USE
ORDINANCE, ARTICLE I, Section E.4.b. Said notice to indicate the nature of the
application, and the time, date, and place of hearing. The Board shall act on the
application within 45 (forty-five) days of the date of the first consideration.
5. Standards of Review – Prior to allowance for variance, the Board of Appeals shall make
specific findings that all of the standards for the type of variance being sought have been
met and that the requirements of this Code applicable to an item for which a variance may
be granted will impose an undue hardship on the property of the owner. No variance shall
be granted solely on economic considerations.
a. Undue Hardship Variance:
i. That the relief south would not adversely affect adjoining property or property in the
same neighborhood, or in the same zoning district and would not endanger the
public health, safety, or convenience of the inhabitants of the Town of West Bath,
nor would it impair the integrity of the Ordinance and COMPREHENSIVE PLAN of
the Town of West Bath.
ii. That the hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or by a previous
owner.
iii. That the need for variance is due to unique circumstances of the property and not
to the general conditions of the neighborhood.
iv. That all other requirements of the Land Use and Development Review Ordinance
have been or will be met.
v. That the land in question cannot yield a reasonable return unless a variance is
granted.
vi. That the granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality.
b. Disability Variance – The Board may grant a variance to an owner of a dwelling for the
purpose of making that dwelling accessible to a PERSON with a disability who resides
in or regularly uses that dwelling. The Board shall restrict any variance granted under
this subsection solely to the installation of equipment or the construction of
STRUCTURES necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling by the PERSON
with the disability. The Board may impose conditions on the variance, including limiting
the variance to the duration of the disability or to the time that the PERSON with the 
69
disability lives in the dwelling. For the purposes of this subsection, a disability has the
same meaning as a physical or mental handicap under Title 5 § 4553 and the term
“STRUCTURES necessary for access to or egress from the dwelling” is defined to
include railing, wall or roof systems necessary for the safety or effectiveness of the
STRUCTURE.
c. SETBACK Variance for single-family dwellings – A variance may be granted from a
set-back requirement only when strict application of the zoning Ordinance to the
petitioner and the petitioner’s property would cause undue hardship. The Board may
attach reasonable conditions, which it finds necessary to protect the privacy of
abutting property owners and neighbors. These conditions are limited to specifications
for landscaping, fencing and parking. The term “undue hardship” as used in this
subsection means:
i. The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not
the general conditions in the neighborhood;
ii. The granting of a variance will not alter the essential character of the locality;
iii. The hardship is not the result of action taken by the applicant or a prior owner;
iv. The granting of the variance will not substantially reduce or impair the use of
abutting property; and
v. That the granting of a variance is based upon demonstrated need, not convenience,
and no other feasible alternative is available.
A variance granted under this subsection is strictly limited to permitting a variance from
a set-back requirement for a single-family dwelling that is the primary year-round
residence of the petitioner. A variance under this subsection may not exceed 20% of a
SETBACK requirement and may not be granted if the variance would cause the area
of the dwelling to exceed the maximum permissible LOT coverage.
d. Practical difficulty/dimensional standards variance – The Board may grant a variance
from the dimensional standards of a zoning Ordinance when strict application of the
Ordinance to the petitioner and the petitioner’s property would cause a practical
difficulty and when the following conditions exist:
i. The need for a variance is due to the unique circumstances of the property and not
the general condition of the neighborhood;
ii. The granting of a variance will not produce an undesirable change in the character
of the neighborhood and will not unreasonably detrimentally affect the use or market
value of abutting properties;
iii. The practical difficulty is not the result of action taken by the petitioner or a prior
owner;
iv. No other feasible alternative to a variance is available to the petitioner or a prior
owner;
70
v. The granting of a variance will not unreasonably adversely affect the natural
environment; and
vi. The property is not located in whole or in part within shoreland areas as described
in Title 38 § 435.
6. Conditions of Approval – The Board of Appeals is empowered to impose such conditions
on the property owner as are necessary and appropriate to protect abutting property
owners or the Town as a whole from any adverse impact resulting from the granting of
such a variance. Any violation of such condition imposed by the Board of Appeals shall
